# UPenn Robotics: Vision Intelligence and Machine Learning

My coursework for the the EdX course by the University of Pennsylvania.

Remaining code will not be uploaded.

The course is free here: https://www.edx.org/course/robotics-vision-intelligence-machine-pennx-robo2x

*"In this course, which is part of the Robotics MicroMasters Program, you will understand how Machine Learning extracts statistically meaningful patterns in data that support classification, regression and clustering. Then by studying Computer Vision and Machine Learning together you will be able to build recognition algorithms that can learn from data and adapt to new environments. Upon completion of this course, you will be able to program vision capabilities for a robot such as robot localization as well as object recognition using machine learning. Projects in this course will utilize MATLAB and OpenCV and will include real examples of video stabilization, recognition of 3D objects, coding a classifier for objects, building a perceptron, and designing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using one of the standard CNN frameworks."*
